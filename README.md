# Cohort-7-Screening-Tasks
These are some of the tasks that were solved for the QSOF mentorship program


##Task 4 
###Question:
####Design a function that generates a random quantum circuit by considering as parameters the number of qubits, the number of depths, and the base of gates to be used. You could only use the quantum gates of 1 and 2 qubits.

def random_circuit (int:num_qubits, int:depth, list:basis_gates):
     “””
num_qubits : integer value that is the number of qubits.
depth: integer value that is the depth for the random circuit.
basis_gates : ilist that contains the basis gates to generate the quantum circuit.
Return the quantum circuit
     “””

     # use a framework that works with quantum circuits, qiskit, cirq, pennylane, etc. 

      # print your quantum circuit,
